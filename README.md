The visualizations and dashboard contained in the workbook displays information about the frequency of wildlife collisions, the extent of damage caused, and the associated cost of damages. This analysis also displays the rankings in terms of the airport's business, and explores whether there is any correlation between the frequency of wildlife collisions and airport popularity.
